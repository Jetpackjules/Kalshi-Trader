RULES:

NHIGH
 Scope:	These	rules	shall	apply	to	the	contract	referred	to	as	NHIGH.
 Underlying:	The	Underlying	for	this	Contract	is	the	maximum	temperature	recorded	for	the	
specified	<date>	published	in	the	National	Weather	Service’s	(“NWS”)	Daily	Climate	Report	for	
Central	Park,	New	York.	Revisions	made	to	the	Underlying	made	after	Expiration	will	not	be	
taken	into	account.
 Instructions:	The	Daily	Climate	Report	for	Central	Park,	New	York	can	be	accessed	here:	
https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=okx
 Click	on	“Observed	Weather”.	Under	“Choose	a	
Location”,	select	“Central	Park	NY”.	The	Underlying	is	in	the	section	labeled	“Temperature”	and	
“Yesterday”	in	a	column	titled	“Observed	Value”	and	row	titled	“Maximum”.	Temperatures	are	
reported	in	degrees	Fahrenheit.	As	stated	on	the	NWS	website,	“These	data	are	preliminary”	and	
“are	subject	to	revision.”	Data	that	is	revised	past	the	Expiration	Date	and	Expiration	time	of	the	
contract	will	not	be	used	to	determine	the	Expiration	Value	of	the	Contract.	Revisions	made	
during	the	statistical	period	or	the	period	between	the	Last	Trading	Date	and	Time	and	
Expiration	Date	and	Expiration	time	may	be	taken	into	account	in	settling	the	contract.	
These	instructions	are	provided	for	convenience	only	and	may	be	modified	or	clarified	at	any	
time.
 Source	Agency:	The	Source	Agency	is	the	National	Weather	Service	(“NWS”).
 Type:	The	type	of	Contract	is	a	Binary	Contract.
 Issuance:	The	Contract	is	based	on	the	outcome	of	a	recurrent	data	release	which	is	issued	on	a	
daily	basis.	Thus,	Contract	iterations	will	be	issued	on	a	recurring	basis,	and	future	Contract	
iterations	will	generally	correspond	to	the	next	day	
Degrees:	Kalshi	may	list	NHIGH	contracts	with	<degrees>	levels	that	fall	within	an	inclusive	
range	between	a	maximum	value	of	130	degrees	Fahrenheit	and	a	minimum	value	of	-30	degrees	
Fahrenheit	at	consecutive	increments	of	1	degree.	Due	to	the	potential	for	variability	in	the	
Underlying,	the	Exchange	may	modify	<degrees>	levels	in	response	to	suggestions	by	
Members.	
Date:	<date>	refers	to	a	date	specified	by	Kalshi.	Kalshi	may	list	contracts	corresponding	to	
different	statistical	periods	of	<date>.
 Payout	Criterion:	The	Payout	Criterion	encompasses	the	Expiration	Values	that	are	<greater	
than/less	than/between>	<degrees>.	If	the	value	of	<greater	than/less	than/between>	is	
“between”,	then	<degrees>	shall	be	a	pair	of	degrees,	and	an	Expiration	Value	that	is	greater	
than	or	equal	to	the	lower	value	of	the	degree	pair	and	less	than	or	equal	to	the	greater	value	of	
the	degree	pair	are	encompassed	in	the	Payout	Criterion.	If	the	value	of	<greater	than/less	
than/between>	is	“greater	than”,	then	the	Payout	Criterion	only	encompasses	Expiration	Values	
that	are	strictly	greater	than	<degrees>	(e.g.	if	the	strike	variable	values	are	“greater	than”	and	
“56	degrees”,	then	an	Expiration	Value	of	56	degrees	is	not	encompassed	in	the	Payout	
Criterion).	If	the	value	of	<greater	than/less	than/between>	is	“less	than”,	then	the	Payout	
Criterion	only	encompasses	Expiration	Values	that	are	strictly	less	than	<degrees>.
 Minimum	Tick:	The	Minimum	Tick	size	for	the	referred	Contract	shall	be	$0.01.
Position	Limit:	The	Position	Limit	for	the	$1	referred	Contract	shall	be	$25,000	per	Member.
 Last	Trading	Date:	The	Last	Trading	Date	shall	be	<date>	and	the	Last	Trading	Time	will	be	
11:59pm	ET.

8:00	AM	ET	following	the	release	of	the	data	for	<date>,	or	one	week	after	<date>.	
Determination	will	be	delayed	until	11AM	ET	in	the	case	of	either	(1)	High	temperature	is	not	
consistent	with	6-hr	or	24-hr	highs	reported	by	METAR	or	(2)	the	Final	report	high	is	lower	than	
earlier	report(s).
 Expiration	time:	The	Expiration	time	of	the	Contract	shall	be	the	sooner	of	the	first	7:00	or	8:00
